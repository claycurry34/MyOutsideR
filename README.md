# My Remote for R projects
## Objective
This repo was created to show off my statistics project created in R. Many of these projects are based on curriculum from Wayne Stewart's "Applied Statistical Methods" (MATH 4753) course, which I took during the Fall 2020 semester at the University of Oklahoma.
