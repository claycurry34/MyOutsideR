# Intro
this lab covers practicalities of continuous random variables and their distributions.

## basic properies of densities
$$ 
1. \hspace{6pt} f(y) \ge 0
$$

$$ 
2. \hspace{6pt} \int^{+\infty}_{-\infty} f(y)\hspace{2pt}dy=1
$$

$$ 
3. \hspace{6pt} P(a < Y < b)= \int_a^b f(y)\hspace{2pt}dy = F(b)-F(a)
$$

## example

The gamma function $\Gamma(t)$, is defined from the Gamma density, $Y$ is a random variable with distribution $Gamma(\alpha, \beta)$.
$$
\Gamma(t) = \int^{\infty}_0y^{t-1}e^{-y}dy = (t-1)! 
$$

1. Plot densities
2. Make areas under the curve
3. Calculate probabilities
4. Create a function that calculates and displays areas
5. Add this function to a package
