# Task 2
**Reading in data set relating heights of spruce trees to breast height diameter. . .**

```{r}
spruce.df = read.csv("SPRUCE.csv")
head(spruce.df)
```

# Task 3
**Create a scatter plot to view the relationship between Tree Height and BHDiameter**

```{r}
plot(Height~BHDiameter, main = "Tree Height vs BHDiameter", xlab = "Breast Height Diameter (cm)", ylab = "Height of Spruce Tree (m)", pch = 21, bg = "blue", cex = 1.2, xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) *1.1), ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), data = spruce.df)
```

***Does there appear to be a straight line relationship?***
In the right half of the plot, there does seem to be a linear relationship. However, for smaller values of BHD, it appears the data set deviates significantly from a linear model. Modeling the entire data set would require some sort of curve.




```{r}
library(s20x)
lo = layout(matrix(1:3, nr=3, nc = 1, byrow = TRUE))
tsone = trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, f=0.5, data = spruce.df)
tsone = trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, f=0.6, data = spruce.df)
tsone = trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, f=0.7, data = spruce.df)
```

**creating a linear model for spruce.df**

```{r}
spruce.lm = with(spruce.df, lm(Height~BHDiameter))
```

Make a new scatter plot and add the least squares regression line

```{r}
lo = layout(1)
with(spruce.df,
     plot(Height~BHDiameter, main = "Tree Height vs BH Diameter", xlab = "Breast Height Diameter (cm)", ylab = "Tree Height (m)", bg = "Blue", pch=21, cex=1.2, xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) *1.1), ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1)
          )
     )

abline(spruce.lm)
```

**Comment on the graph, is a straight line appropriate? Consider the smoother curve also.**
