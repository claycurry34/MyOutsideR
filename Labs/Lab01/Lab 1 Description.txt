Labs will generally be due on Fridays -- the first week is an exception!

All labs/assignments will need to be uploaded to CANVAS as knitted html documents.  No html? Then no marks!!

Please note that for some of you,  getting up to speed with R will test your endurance and patience. Using all available helps will assist to prevent code exhaustion. 

You MUST use R markdown for all work - labs, assignments, minilabs and projects.

You can get help for all labs by:-

examining the parallel code in lab?.R
using help in RStudio -- see menu
Use R help ?getwd etc on the command line
