# Task 1
```{r}
getwd()
```

# Task 2
```{r}
spruce.df <- read.csv("SPRUCE.csv")
tail(spruce.df)
```

# Task 3

## Lowess smoother scatter plot
```{r}
library(s20x)
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, data = spruce.df, f = 0.5)
```

## Make a linear model
```{r}
spruce.lm = with(spruce.df, lm(Height~BHDiameter))
```

## Find residuals
```{r}
height.res = residuals(spruce.lm)
```

## Find fitted values
```{r}
height.fit = fitted(spruce.lm)
```

## Residuals vs. Fitted
```{r}
plot(y = height.res, x = height.fit)
```

## Residuals vs. Fitted using Trendscatter
```{r}
trendscatter(y=height.res, x = height.fit)
```

## Shape of Plot
The plot resembles a hyperbolic
## Residual plot

## Check normality
```{r}
normcheck(spruce.lm, shapiro.wilk = TRUE)
```

## P-Value and Null-Hypothesis

Because the p=value is greater than 0.05, we accept the null hypothesis which says our error is distributed normally.

According to the Lab 4 task sheet, if the model works well, we should expect residuals that are approximately normal in distribution with mean 0 and constant variance.

## Evaluating the model
```{r}
round(mean(height.res), 4)
```

The mean is 0 for the residuals.
## Conclusion
Based on the ashape of the plot of residuals vs. fitted height values, we should not use a straight line model. The shape has a distinct quadratic shape. We are finding 'signal' when we should just be finding 'noise'. Because this model does not properly fit the data, we must adjust our model.
